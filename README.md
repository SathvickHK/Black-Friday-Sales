# Black Friday Sales  Prediction 

- This project aims to predict the sales figures for the upcoming Black Friday sale based on historical sales data and customer demographics. Using machine learning algorithms, we analyze factors such as customer age, gender, occupation, and purchase history to predict sales figures for different product categories.  
- The insights gained from this project can be used by retailers to optimize their pricing strategies and improve their sales performance.
- The code and results are documented in the accompanying Jupyter notebook, and the model performance is evaluated using various metrics.
